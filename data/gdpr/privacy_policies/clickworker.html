      § 10.2 Google Firebase
     </h3>
     <p>
      Our app uses the technology of Google Firebase (Google Inc., 1600 Amphitheatre Parkway, Mountain View, CA 94043, USA, "Google"). Firebase is part of the Google Cloud Platform and offers a real-time database as well as the following services:
     </p>
     <p>
      Firebase Analytics and Google Analytics enable the analysis of the use of our offer. Information regarding the use of our app is collected, transmitted to Google and stored there. Google uses the advertising ID of the end device for this purpose. Google will use this information to anonymously evaluate the use of our app and to provide us with further services associated with the use of apps. In the device settings, you can restrict the use of the advertising ID (iOS: Data protection/ advertising/ No ad tracking; Android: Account/ Google/ Ads).
     </p>
     <p>
      <b>
       Examples of information about the use of the app
      </b>
      <br/>
      Job list viewed, job accepted, job discarded, job successfully transferred, error when transferring the job or other functions of the app, device information (manufacturer, model, operating system, operating system version).
     </p>
     <p>
      <b>
       Firebase Crash Reporting
      </b>
      serves the stability and improvement of the app. It collects information about the device used and the use of our app (for example, the timestamp when the app started and when the crash occurred), which allows us to diagnose and resolve problems.
     </p>
     <p>
      <b>
       Firebase Performance
      </b>
      <br/>
      Firebase Performance Monitoring is a service that gives us insight into the features of our app. We use the Performance Monitoring SDK to collect performance data from our app and to check and analyze this data. This data helps us to understand where and when our app's performance can be improved.
     </p>
     <p>
      <b>
       Dynamic Links
      </b>
      <br/>
      By using Dynamic Links, the users of our app get the best possible experience for the platform on which they open a link from our system.  When a user opens a Dynamic Link under iOS or Android, they can be redirected directly to the linked content in your native app. When a user opens the same Dynamic Link in a desktop browser, they can be redirected to the appropriate content on your website. In addition, Dynamic Links work for app installations:  If a user opens a Dynamic Link under iOS or Android and has not installed your app, the user may be prompted to install it.  After installation, your app will launch and access the link.
     </p>
     <p>
      <b>
       Storage duration of data
      </b>
      in Firebase: The data is deleted after the user has been inactive for two months.

     <p>
      The use of the plugins below enables the interaction with social networks and other users so that we can improve our offerings and make them more interesting to you as a user. The legal basis for the use of the plugins is Art. 6 par. 1 sentence 1 lit. f GDPR.
      <br/>
      This website uses social plugins ("plugins") of the following social networks:
     </p>
     <ul>

      <li>
       Google+

     </ul>
     <p>
      We use the so-called two-click solution. In other words, when you visit our site, no personal data is initially passed on to the providers of the plugins. The provider of the plugin can be identified by the marking on the box above its initial letter or logo. We enable the direct communication with the provider of the plugin via the button. The plugin provider receives the information that you have accessed the corresponding website of our online service only if you click on the marked field and activate it.
     </p>
     <p>
      By using the plugin, the plugin provider is informed that you have accessed the corresponding website of our online service. In addition, the IP address, the date and time of the request; the time zone difference to Greenwich Mean Time; the content of the request (concrete page); the access status / HTTP status code; the amount of data transferred; the website from which the request comes, the browser; the operating system and its interface and the language, as well as the version of the browser software are also transmitted.
     </p>
     <p>
      According to the provider, the IP address will be anonymized immediately after collection. By activating the plugin, personal data may be transmitted by you to the respective plugin provider and stored there (with U.S. providers in the USA). Since the plugin provider carries out the data collection, in particular via cookies, we recommend that you delete all cookies before clicking on the greyed-out box via the security settings of your browser.
     </p>
     <p>
      The plugin provider stores the data collected about you as usage profiles and uses them for purposes of advertising, market research and / or tailor-made website design. This type of evaluation is carried out in particular (also for non-logged-in users) for the presentation of needs-based advertising and to inform other social network users about your activities on our website. You have the right to object to the formation of these user profiles, whereby you must contact the respective plugin provider to exercise it.
     </p>
     <p>
      The data transfer takes place regardless of whether you have an account with the plugin provider and are logged in there. If you are logged into the plugin provider, your data collected from us will be assigned directly to your existing account with the plugin provider. If you click on the activated button and, for example, link the page, the plugin provider also stores this information in your user account and shares it publicly with your contacts. We recommend logging out regularly after using a social network, but especially before activating the button, as this will prevent you from being assigned to your profile with the plugin provider.
     </p>
     <p>
      We have no control over the collected data and data processing operations, nor are we aware of the full extent of data collection, the purpose of the processing, the retention periods. We also have no information regarding deletion of the data collected by the plugin provider.
     </p>
     <p>
      For further information on the purpose and scope of the data collection and its processing by the plugin provider, please refer to the privacy statements of these providers provided below. There you will also find further information about your rights and settings options for the protection of your privacy.

      §  14 Embedding of YouTube videos
     </h2>
     <p>
      We have included YouTube videos as part of our online services; these are stored on
      <a href="http://www.YouTube.com" target="_blank">
       http://www.YouTube.com
      </a>
      and playable from our website.
     </p>
     <p>
      Embedding of the videos takes place with the aid of the so-called two-click solution or in the extended data protection mode. In other words, when you visit our site, no personally identifiable information will be passed on to YouTube. YouTube will receive the information that you have accessed the corresponding bottom of our website only if you activate the video with a click. In addition, the IP address, the date and time of the request; the time zone difference to Greenwich Mean Time; the content of the request (concrete page); the access status / HTTP status code; the amount of data transferred; the website from which the request comes, the browser; the operating system and its interface and the language as well as the version of the browser software. This happens regardless of whether YouTube provides a user account that you are logged in to, or if there is no user account. When you're logged in to Google, your data will be assigned directly to your account. If you do not wish to be associated with your profile on YouTube, you must log out before activating the button. YouTube stores your data as usage profiles and uses them for purposes of advertising, market research and / or custom design of its website. This type of evaluation is done (even for users who are not logged in) to provide appropriate advertising and to inform other users of the social network about their activities on our website. You have the right to object to the creation of these User Profiles, and you must be directed to YouTube to use them.
     </p>
     <p>
      For more information on the purpose and scope of your data collection and processing through YouTube, please read the privacy policy. You'll also get more information about your rights and privacy settings here:

     <h2>
      §  15 Use of external Captcha
     </h2>
     <p>
      We use the Google reCaptcha program from Google Inc. The purpose of the program is to distinguish between natural persons and automated and automated processing. We need this distinction to prevent misuse of the content through automated processing. The legal basis for this is Art. 6 par. 1 sentence 1 lit. f GDPR. Data is forwarded to Google when the site visitor uses reCaptcha. This data includes the IP address, the date and time of the request; the time zone difference to Greenwich Mean Time; the content of the request (concrete page); the access status / HTTP status code; the amount of data transferred; the website from which the request comes, the browser; the operating system and its interface and the language as well as the version of the browser software.
     </p>
     <p>
      Google will truncate your IP address within member states of the European Union or in other contracting states of the Agreement on the European Economic Area. The full IP address will only be sent to a Google server in the U.S. and shortened there in exceptional cases. Google will use this information on behalf of the operator of this website to evaluate your use of this service. The IP address sent by your browser as part of reCaptcha will not be merged with other data provided by Google. This data is subject to the deviating privacy policies of Google.
