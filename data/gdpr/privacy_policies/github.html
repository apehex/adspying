      "User Personal Information" is any personal information about one of our users which could, alone or together with other information, personally identify them. Information such as a user name and password, an email address, a real name, and a photograph are examples of “User Personal Information.” User Personal Information includes Personal Data as defined in the General Data Protection Regulation.
     </p>
     <p>
      "Technical Information" may include information we collect from website browsers, such as web server logs, or other log information, such as User session or activity logs. Technical Information may be connected to User Personal Information such as a username or an email address, or to other potentially personally-identifying information like Internet Protocol (IP) addresses.
     </p>
     <p>
      User Personal Information does not include aggregated, non-personally identifying information. We may use aggregated, non-personally identifying information to operate, analyze, improve, and optimize our website and service.

     <p>
      The information we collect about all visitors to our website includes the visitor’s browser type, language preference, referring site, additional websites requested, and the date and time of each visitor request.

      <li>
       We use your User Personal Information, specifically your user name, to identify you on GitHub.
      </li>
      <li>
       We use it to fill out your profile and share that profile with other users if you ask us to.

      <li>
       We will use your email address to communicate with you, if you've said that's okay,

      </li>
      <li>
       We use User Personal Information and other data to make recommendations for you, such as to suggest projects you may want to follow or contribute to. For example, when you fill out an interest survey at account creation, we learn from it — as well as from your public behavior on GitHub, such as the projects you star — to determine your coding interests, and we recommend similar projects. These recommendations are automated decisions, but they have no legal impact on your rights.
      </li>
      <li>
       We collect Technical Information to better understand how our website visitors use GitHub, and to monitor and protect the security of the website.
      </li>
      <li>
       We collect personal information from third parties for the purposes for which it was authorized to be collected. For example, you may authorize GitHub to contact you for marketing purposes via a third party's platform. If we need to use your personal information for other purposes, we will ask your permission first.

     </h5>
     <p>
      Under certain international laws (including GDPR), GitHub is required to notify you about the legal basis on which we process User Personal Information. GitHub processes User Personal Information on the following legal bases:
     </p>
     <ul>
      <li>
       <p>
        Contract Performance:
       </p>
       <ul>
        <li>
         When you create a GitHub account, you provide your user name and an email address. We require those data elements for you to enter into the Terms of Service agreement with us, and we process those elements on the basis of performing that contract. We also process your user name and email address on other bases.
        </li>
        <li>
         If you have a GitHub Hosted, GitHub Enterprise Server, or other paid account with us, there will be other data elements we must collect and process on the basis of performing that contract. GitHub does not collect or process a credit card number, but our third-party payment processor does.
        </li>
        <li>
         When you sell a Marketplace application or receive funds through the Sponsors Program, you provide identification and banking information. We process those elements on the basis of performing the contract that applies to those services.
        </li>
       </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
       <p>
        Consent:
       </p>
       <ul>
        <li>
         As a user, you can fill out the information in your
         <a href="https://github.com/settings/profile">
          user profile
         </a>
         , and you have the option to provide User Personal Information such as your full name, an avatar which may include a photograph, your biography, your location, your company, and a URL to a third party website. You also have the option of setting a publicly visible email address here. If you decide to participate in a GitHub research project or survey, you may choose to provide User Personal Information or other personal information to us for limited purposes.  We process this information on the basis of consent. All of this information is entirely optional, and you have the ability to access, modify, and delete it at any time (while you are not able to delete your email address entirely, you can make it private).
        </li>
       </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
       <p>
        Legitimate Interests:
       </p>
       <ul>
        <li>
         Generally, the remainder of the processing of personal information we perform is necessary for the purposes of our legitimate interests. For example, for legal compliance purposes or to maintain ongoing confidentiality, integrity, availability and resilience of GitHub's systems, website, and service, we must keep logs of Technical Information; and, in order to respond to legal process, we are required to keep records of users who have sent and received DMCA takedown notices.
        </li>
       </ul>

      </strong>
      , such as social security numbers, genetic data, health information, or religious information, unless you sell a Marketplace application or raise funds through the Sponsors Program. Although GitHub does not request or intentionally collect any other sensitive personal information, we realize that you might store this kind of information in your account, such as in a repository or in your public profile. If you store any sensitive personal information on our servers, you are responsible for complying with any regulatory controls regarding that data.

      If you're a

If we learn or have reason to suspect that you are a user who is under the age of 13, we will unfortunately have to close your account.

      We do share User Personal Information with your permission, so we can perform services you have requested or communicate on your behalf. For example, if you purchase an integration or other Developer Product from our Marketplace, we will share your account name to allow the integrator to provide you services. Additionally, you may indicate, through your actions on GitHub, that you are willing to share your User Personal Information. For example, if you join an organization, the owner of the organization will have the ability to view your activity in the organization's access log. We will respect your choices.
     </p>
     <p>
      We
      <strong>
       do not
      </strong>
      share, sell, rent, or trade User Personal Information with third parties for their commercial purposes, except where you have specifically told us to (such as by buying an integration from Marketplace).

     <p>
      We
      <strong>
       do not
      </strong>
      host advertising on GitHub. We may occasionally embed content from third party sites, such as YouTube, and that content may include ads. While we try to minimize the amount of ads our embedded content contains, we can't always control what third parties show. Any advertisements on individual GitHub Pages or in GitHub repositories are not sponsored by, or tracked by, GitHub.
     </p>
     <p>
      We
      <strong>
       do not
      </strong>
      disclose User Personal Information outside GitHub, except in the situations listed in this section or in the section below on

       do
      </strong>
      share certain aggregated, non-personally identifying information with others about how our users, collectively, use GitHub, or how our users respond to our other offerings, such as our conferences or events. For example, we may

     <p>
      We
      <strong>
       do
      </strong>
      share User Personal Information with a limited number of third party vendors who process it on our behalf to provide or improve our service, and who have agreed to privacy restrictions similar to our own Privacy Statement by signing data protection agreements. Our vendors perform services such as payment processing, customer support ticketing, network data transmission, and other similar services. When we transfer your data to our vendors under
      <a href="/en/articles/github-privacy-statement/#githubs-global-privacy-practices">
       EU-US and Swiss-US Privacy Shield Frameworks
      </a>

      We do share aggregated, non-personally identifying information with third parties. For example, we share the number of stars on a repository, or in the event of a security incident, we may share the number of times a particular file was accessed.
     </p>
     <p>
      We may share User Personal Information if we are involved in a merger, sale, or acquisition. If any such change of ownership happens, we will ensure that it is under terms that preserve the confidentiality of User Personal Information, and we will notify you on our website or by email before any transfer of your User Personal Information. The organization receiving any User Personal Information will have to honor any promises we have made in our Privacy Statement or in our Terms of Service.

     <p>
      Much of GitHub is public-facing. If your content is public-facing, third parties may access and use it in compliance with our Terms of Service, such as by viewing your profile or repositories or pulling data via our API. We do not sell that content; it is yours. However, we do allow third parties, such as research organizations or archives, to compile public-facing GitHub information. Other third parties, such as data brokers, have been known to scrape GitHub and compile data as well.
     </p>
     <p>
      Your User Personal Information, associated with your content, could be gathered by third parties in these compilations of GitHub data. If you do not want your User Personal Information to appear in third parties’ compilations of GitHub data, please do not make your personal information publicly available and be sure to

     <p>
      If you would like to compile GitHub data, you must comply with our Terms of Service regarding

      </a>
      , and you may only use any public-facing User Personal Information you gather for the purpose for which our user has authorized it. For example, where a GitHub user has made an email address public-facing for the purpose of identification and attribution, do not use that email address for commercial advertising. We expect you to reasonably secure any User Personal Information you have gathered from GitHub, and to respond promptly to complaints, removal requests, and "do not contact" requests from GitHub or GitHub users.
     </p>
     <p>
      Similarly, projects on GitHub may include publicly available User Personal Information collected as part of the collaborative process. In the event that a GitHub project contains publicly available personal information that does not belong to GitHub users, we will only use that personal information for the limited purpose for which it was collected, and we will secure that personal information as we would secure any User Personal Information.

     <p>
      GitHub takes all measures reasonably necessary to protect User Personal Information from unauthorized access, alteration, or destruction; maintain data accuracy; and help ensure the appropriate use of User Personal Information.
     </p>
     <p>
      GitHub enforces a written security information program. Our program:
     </p>
     <ul>
      <li>
       aligns with industry recognized frameworks;
      </li>
      <li>
       includes security safeguards reasonably designed to protect the confidentiality, integrity, availability, and resilience of our users' data;
      </li>
      <li>
       is appropriate to the nature, size, and complexity of GitHub’s business operations;
      </li>
      <li>
       includes incident response and data breach notification processes; and
      </li>
      <li>
       complies with applicable information security related laws and regulations in the geographic regions where GitHub does business.
      </li>
     </ul>
     <p>
      In the event of a data breach that affects your User Personal Information, we will act promptly to mitigate the impact of a breach and notify any affected users without undue delay.
     </p>
     <p>
      Transmission of data on GitHub is encrypted using SSH, HTTPS, and SSL/TLS, and git repository content is encrypted at rest. We manage our own cages and racks at top-tier data centers with excellent physical and network security, and when data is stored with a third party storage provider, it is encrypted.
     </p>
     <p>
      No method of transmission, or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure. Therefore, we cannot guarantee its absolute security. For more information, see our

      <strong>
       We store and process the information that we collect in the United States
      </strong>
      in accordance with this Privacy Statement (our subprocessors may store and process data outside the United States). However, we understand that we have users from different countries and regions with different privacy expectations, and we try to meet those needs even when the United States does not have the same privacy framework as other countries'.
     </p>
     <p>
      We provide a high standard of privacy protection — as described in this Privacy Statement — to all our users around the world, regardless of their country of origin or location, and we are proud of the levels of notice, choice, accountability, security, data integrity, access, and recourse we provide. We work hard to comply with the applicable data privacy laws wherever we do business, working with our Data Protection Officer as part of a cross-functional team that oversees our privacy compliance efforts. Additionally, if our vendors or affiliates have access to User Personal Information, they must sign agreements that require them to comply with our privacy policies and with applicable data privacy laws.
     </p>
     <p>
      In particular:
     </p>
     <ul>
      <li>
       GitHub provides clear methods of unambiguous, informed consent at the time of data collection, when we do collect your personal information using consent as a basis.
      </li>
      <li>
       We collect only the minimum amount of personal information necessary for our purposes, unless you choose to provide more. We encourage you to only give us the amount of data you are comfortable sharing.
      </li>
      <li>
       We offer you simple methods of accessing, correcting, or deleting the User Personal Information we have collected.
      </li>
      <li>
       We provide our users notice, choice, accountability, security, and access, and we limit the purpose for processing. We also provide our users a method of recourse and enforcement. These are the Privacy Shield Principles, but they are also just good practices.

     </p>
     <p>
      In complying with court orders and similar legal processes, GitHub strives for transparency.

We also send marketing emails, based on your choices and in accordance with applicable laws and regulations. There's an unsubscribe link located at the bottom of each of the marketing emails we send you. Please note that you can not opt out of receiving important communications from us, such as emails from our Support team or system emails, but you can configure your notifications settings in your profile.

     <p>
      Our emails might contain a pixel tag, which is a small, clear image that can tell us whether or not you have opened an email and what your IP address is. We use this pixel tag to make our email more effective for you and to make sure we’re not sending you unwanted email.
