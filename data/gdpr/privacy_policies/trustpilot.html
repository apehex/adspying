Some information about you will automatically be collected from Social Networks when connecting your Trustpilot profile with your profile on Social Networks.
    </p>
    <p>
     The information collected from Social Networks depends on what information you have made available on the network and your privacy settings for sharing such information on the network. Depending on the settings, we may e.g. collect the following information about you:
    </p>
    <ul>
     <li>

    </p>
    <p>
     The purpose of collecting information from Social Networks is to connect members of your network, which are both users of Trustpilot and of one or more of the Social Networks, and thereby both increase the confidence in the reviews made by the members of the network as well as create a better user experience on the Website.

     Trustpilot shall be data controller of the master data you enter in connection with your creation of a profile or registration for newsletters, i.e. your name, your password and your email address, as well as registration of your IP address.
    </p>

    <p>
     3.2  The information for which you are the data controller
    </p>
    <p>
     You shall be data controller of the content you choose to disclose on the Website and for the data disclosed on your profile on Social Networks, which is the consequence of the connection of your profile on the Website with your profile on the Social Network.
    </p>
    <p>
     3.3  Links to websites
    </p>
    <p>
     The Website contains links to other websites. Note that by clicking such links you will be transferred to other websites for which Trustpilot is not the data controller. We thus recommend that you always read the personal data policy of these websites, as their procedure for collecting and processing personal data may be different from ours.
    </p>
    <h3>
     4.  Data processor
    </h3>
    <p>
     Trustpilot uses an external company for maintaining the technical operation of the Website. This company is the data processor with regards to the personal data for which Trustpilot is the data controller.
    </p>
    <p>
     By accepting this personal data policy, you accept that Trustpilot also allows the data for which you are the data controller be processed by the same data processor.
    </p>
    <p>
     The data processor shall solely act according to instructions from Trustpilot. By accepting these terms and conditions, you authorize Trustpilot to give such instructions to the data processor which are necessary for the processing of data in accordance with this personal data policy and for the purpose of use of the Website.
    </p>
    <p>
     The data processor has made necessary technical and organizational safety measures against the information being accidentally or illegally destroyed, lost or deteriorated, and against the information coming to the knowledge of unauthorized persons, is misused or in other ways is processed in violation with the act on processing of personal data. On your request – and against remuneration of the data processor’s current hourly rates at any time for such work – the data processor shall supply you with sufficient information to demonstrate that the above-mentioned technical and organizational safety measures have been made.
    </p>
    <p>
     Trustpilot may now or in the future process and/or store personal data in the U.S. If you access or use the Website from a location outside of the U.S., you consent to the transfer, storage and processing of your personal data in the U.S.

    <h3>
     5.  Security measures
    </h3>
    <p>
     Trustpilot will use commercially reasonable efforts to see that the recorded data, including the personal information, under its control is handled using appropriate security measures. Trustpilot regularly audits its system for possible vulnerabilities and attacks. However, since the internet is not a 100% secure environment, Trustpilot cannot ensure or warrant the security of information you transmit to Trustpilot. Emails sent via the Website are not encrypted, and Trustpilot therefore advises you not to communicate any confidential information through these means.
