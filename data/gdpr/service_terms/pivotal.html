       Professional Services Terms and Conditions
      </div>
      <br/>
      <p>
       The Statement of Work and/or Services Brief (referred to herein as “SOW”) and performance of the parties thereunder is governed by and subject to these General Terms And Conditions (“T&amp;Cs”) which by reference are incorporated and made a part of the SOW, subject to any quote. Pivotal means (i) Pivotal Software, Inc., if Customer is located in the United States; and (ii) the local Pivotal sales subsidiary, if Customer is located in a country in which Pivotal has a local sales subsidiary; and (iii) Pivotal Software International Limited, if Customer is located outside the United States and in a country in which Pivotal does not have a local sales subsidiary (in each case, referred to herein as “Pivotal”). “Customer” is identified as “Customer” or “You” herein, and collectively referred to with Pivotal as “Parties” or separately as “Party”. The T&amp;Cs (i) are subject to change by Pivotal from time to time; (ii) in effect as of the effective date of the SOW shall apply for the performance of that SOW; (iii) will not apply retroactively to any SOW; and (iv) are dated and archived when superseded by a newer version. Pivotal represents that in the event You have a current signed agreement with Pivotal regarding the subject-matter herein, then the terms and conditions of that agreement supersede any conflicting terms herein.
      </p>
      <p>
       1.	SOW TERMS AND CONDITIONS. Pivotal will provide the services as specified in the SOW ("Services") governed by the T&amp;Cs. In the event of a conflict between a term or condition in an SOW and those set forth here, these T&amp;Cs will govern unless explicitly superseded in the SOW or as otherwise stated in the preamble herein.
      </p>
      <p>
       2.	TERM AND TERMINATION. The SOW begins on the date stated therein or, as otherwise mutually agreed between the Parties, and shall remain in effect for the term length stated in the SOW (“Services Period”). Either Party may notify the other in case of the other’s alleged breach of a material provision of this SOW. The recipient shall have 30 days from the date of receipt of such notice to affect a cure. If the recipient of the notice fails to affect a cure within such period, then the sender of the notice shall have the option of sending a written notice of termination of the SOW, which notice shall take effect upon receipt. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Pivotal may suspend its services or terminate the SOW if Customer fails to pay an invoice when due and if such non-conformance is not cured within 10 days following receipt of notice from Pivotal.
      </p>
      <p>
       3.	PROJECT CHANGE REQUEST. Either Party may request a modification to any material provision of the SOW by submitting a Project Change Request (“PCR”).  Upon receipt of a PCR, Pivotal will estimate the financial and schedule impacts, if any.  The Parties will review these estimates to determine whether the PCR would be mutually acceptable. If the Parties agree on the PCR, Pivotal will attach the final PCR to the SOW.  If the Parties are unable to agree within five (5) business days after the PCR is submitted, then the submitting Party may either withdraw the PCR or terminate the SOW with reasonable notice.  If the SOW is terminated, due to an ability to reach agreement on a PCR, the only payments due are for the Work Product (defined herein below) delivered, Services performed, and expenses incurred by Pivotal prior to the effective termination date.
      </p>
      <p>
       4.	CUSTOMER MATERIALS DELAY. Customer acknowledges that Pivotal’s performance of the Services and delivery of the Work Product is contingent on Customer’s timely delivery of any customer materials (“Customer Materials”) provided to Pivotal in connection with the Services. Customer agrees that any reasonable scheduling or financial impacts caused by Customer’s failure to deliver Customer Materials within the specified time will be treated as a PCR.
      </p>
      <p>
       5.	PERSONNEL. Pivotal will determine the personnel assigned to perform the Services.  Customer may request in writing, with specific legal reasons stated, the replacement of Pivotal personnel or contractors.
      </p>
      <p>
       6.	PAYMENT TERMS. Pivotal shall submit invoices for fees and reimbursable costs and expenses as described in the SOW or quote plus all related taxes and withholdings, except for those based on Pivotal’s net income. If Customer is required to withhold taxes, then Customer will forward any withholding receipts to Pivotal at accounting@pivotal.io. Subject to Pivotal’s credit approval, all amounts are due in the currency stated on the invoice and in full 30 days after the date of Pivotal’s invoice or in the manner specified in the SOW, with interest accruing thereafter at the lesser of 1.5% per month or the highest lawful rate. If all or a portion of any invoice is determined to be incorrect, the Parties will promptly investigate and correct or confirm the dispute. Pivotal is not obligated to perform its services unless Customer is current in payment of all fees and charges due. Except as otherwise set forth herein, payment obligations by Customer to Pivotal shall survive expiration or termination of the SOW.
      </p>
      <p>
       7.	WARRANTY. Pivotal shall perform Services in a workmanlike manner in accordance with generally accepted industry standards. EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY STATED IN THIS WARRANTY SECTION, AND TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, PIVOTAL (INCLUDING ITS SUPPLIERS) MAKES NO OTHER EXPRESS WARRANTIES, WRITTEN OR ORAL, AND DISCLAIMS ALL IMPLIED WARRANTIES. INSOFAR AS PERMITTED UNDER APPLICABLE LAW, ALL OTHER WARRANTIES ARE SPECIFICALLY EXCLUDED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, TITLE AND NON-INFRINGEMENT, AND ANY WARRANTY ARISING BY STATUTE, OPERATION OF LAW, COURSE OF DEALING OR PERFORMANCE, OR USAGE OF TRADE.
      </p>
      <p>

      <p>
       8.1 Ownership. Other than Pivotal Materials, Open Source Software and any Third Party Materials (defined herein) Customer shall own all intellectual property rights associated with the deliverables, works of authorship or other products developed or created and delivered by Pivotal to Customer in the course of performing Services (“Work Product”), as well as Customer’s derivative works thereof, subject to Customer’s payment in full under such SOW and subject to Pivotal’s rights in the underlying intellectual property embodied therein or used by Pivotal to perform the Services.

Pivotal Materials may be included in, or necessary for Customer to use the Work Product but are excluded from Customer's ownership rights set forth in Section 8.1. Pivotal hereby grants to Customer a worldwide, perpetual, royalty-free license to use Pivotal Materials solely as necessary for use as part of the Work Product. No other grants of licenses or rights to Customer will be implied from the provisions stated in this SOW. Customer shall not obliterate or remove and will reproduce Pivotal’s intellectual property notices contained in the Pivotal Materials. Customer shall not reverse engineer, decompile, or otherwise attempt to derive source code from any portions of the Work Product. Pivotal is not being engaged to perform any investigation of third party intellectual property rights including any searches of patents, copyrights, or trademarks related to the Work Product.
      </p>
      <p>
       8.3.	Open source software is software provided under a license approved by the Open Source Initiative or similar open source or freeware license (“OSS”).

Pivotal may (a) obtain such OSS on Customer's behalf, (b) incorporate it into the Work Product, and (c) submit back to open source libraries any improvements made to the OSS during the course of performing the Services, to the extent such submissions do not violate the confidentiality obligations set forth herein.
      </p>
      <p>
       8.4.	Third Party Materials Exclusion. Materials​ (including ​tools ​that ​are used to deliver the Services) that ​are not owned or created by Pivotal (other than Open Source Software) (“Third Party Materials”) ​may be included in, or necessary for Customer to use the Work Product, ​but are excluded from Customer's ownership rights​.​ Customer will be solely responsible for obtaining necessary licenses to the Third Party Materials and liable for their use.
      </p>
      <p>
       8.5.  Reservation of Rights.  Pivotal reserves all rights not expressly granted to Customer in these T&amp;C’s. Except as expressly stated, nothing herein shall be construed to (a) directly or indirectly grant to a receiving party any title to or ownership of a providing party’s intellectual property rights in services or materials furnished by such providing party hereunder, or (b) preclude such providing party from developing, marketing, using, licensing, modifying or otherwise freely exploiting services or materials that are similar to or related to the Services or materials provided hereunder.
      </p>
      <p>
       8.6.  Customer's Underlying Rights. Customer represents and warrants to Pivotal that (a) Customer owns or controls all rights in and to all Customer information and materials provided by or on behalf of Customer to Pivotal pursuant to the SOW, including without limitation all rights to exploit all such Customer information and materials worldwide in all media and languages in perpetuity without encumbrance or restriction, and (b) Customer grants to Pivotal a nonexclusive, nontransferable, worldwide paid-up license to make, use, modify, reproduce, and prepare derivative works of Customer information and materials, solely for the purpose of performing Services, with no right to grant sublicenses.
      </p>
      <p>
       8.7. Feedback License. The Parties agree that any feedback or suggestions (“Feedback”) (if any) given hereunder is voluntary. Each party is free to use, disclose, reproduce, license or otherwise distribute the Feedback relating to its own products and services, without any obligations or restrictions of any kind, including intellectual property rights.
      </p>

      </p>
      <p>
       11.	IP INDEMNITY.
      </p>
      <p>
       11.1. Pivotal. Subject to Section 13 (Limitations of Liability), Pivotal shall (a) defend Customer against any third party claim that the Services and the Work Product (excluding Open Source Software and/or Third Party Materials) delivered by Pivotal to Customer infringe a trade secret, or a copyright enforceable in a country that is a signatory to the Berne Convention, and (b) pay the resulting costs and damages finally awarded against Customer by a court of competent jurisdiction or the amounts stated in a written settlement signed by Pivotal.
      </p>
      <p>
       11.2. Customer. Customer shall (a) defend Pivotal against any third party claim that the materials provided by Customer or its agents for use by Pivotal infringe a trade secret, or a copyright enforceable in a country that is a signatory to the Berne Convention and (b) pay the resulting costs and damages finally awarded against Pivotal by a court of competent jurisdiction or the amounts stated in a written settlement signed by Customer.
      </p>
      <p>
       11.3. Process. The foregoing obligations are subject to the following: the indemnitee (a) notifies the indemnitor promptly in writing of such claim, (b) grants the indemnitor sole control over the defense and settlement thereof, (c) reasonably cooperates in response to an indemnitor request for assistance, and (d) is not in material breach of these T&amp;Cs. Should such a claim be made, or in the indemnitor’s opinion be likely to be made, the indemnitor may, at its option and expense, (i) procure for the indemnitee the right to make continued use thereof, (ii) replace or modify such so that it becomes non-infringing, (iii) request return of the subject material, or (iv) discontinue the Services and refund the portion of any pre-paid Services fee that corresponds to the period of Services discontinuation. THIS SECTION STATES THE INDEMNITEE’S SOLE AND EXCLUSIVE REMEDY AND THE INDEMNITOR’S ENTIRE LIABILITY FOR THIRD PARTY INFRINGEMENT CLAIMS.
      </p>
      <p>
       12. HR/RECRUITING TRAINING SERVICES INDEMNIFICATION. If Pivotal provides any HR/Recruiting Training Services (which for purposes of this section include any services related to personnel including recruiting, hiring, screening, assessing and/or interviewing), the following additional provisions apply to such services: Customer shall, at its expense, defend, indemnify and hold Pivotal and its subsidiaries, affiliates, employees, officers, directors and agents (“Indemnified Persons”) harmless from and against all third party suits, claims, and liabilities, and all associated losses, costs, damages, and expenses, including attorney fees, costs, and expert fees as incurred, (“Losses”) arising out of or relating to (i) any acts or omissions of any Customer personnel; and (ii)any employment or recruitment-related claims or charges of any kind brought against Indemnified Persons, including but not limited to claims alleging that Pivotal is a joint employer, any claims alleging failure to hire, wrongful termination, unlawful discrimination, claims for compensation, wages or benefits of any kind and nature; (each, an “Indemnified Claim”).  No settlement or compromise that imposes any liability or obligation on Indemnified Persons will be made without Pivotal’s prior written consent (not to be unreasonably withheld). Pivotal and its suppliers, subcontractors, employees, and agents provide HR/Recruiting Training Services “AS IS” and make no other express or implied warranties, written or oral, and all other warranties are specifically excluded. Under no circumstances will Pivotal be making, nor will Pivotal be responsible for, any employment recommendations or hiring decisions on behalf of Customer."
      </p>
      <p>
       13.	LIMITATIONS OF LIABILITY. PIVOTAL’S TOTAL LIABILITY AND CUSTOMER’S SOLE AND EXCLUSIVE REMEDY FOR ANY CLAIM OF ANY TYPE WHATSOEVER, ARISING OUT OF THIS SOW OR SERVICES PROVIDED HEREUNDER, SHALL BE LIMITED TO PROVEN DIRECT DAMAGES CAUSED BY PIVOTAL’S SOLE NEGLIGENCE IN AN AMOUNT NOT TO EXCEED THE PRICE PAID TO PIVOTAL FOR THE SERVICES RENDERED HEREUNDER. EXCEPT WITH RESPECT TO CLAIMS REGARDING VIOLATION OF PIVOTAL’S INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS, NEITHER CUSTOMER NOR PIVOTAL SHALL HAVE LIABILITY TO THE OTHER FOR ANY SPECIAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, EXEMPLARY, INCIDENTAL, OR INDIRECT DAMAGES (INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, LOSS OF PROFITS, REVENUES, DATA AND/OR USE), EVEN IF ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY THEREOF.
      </p>
      <p>
       14.	CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION. “Confidential Information” means any information that is marked “confidential” or “proprietary” or any other similar term or in relation to which its confidentiality should by its nature be inferred. Confidential Information does not include information that is (a) rightfully in the receiving party’s possession without prior obligation of confidentiality from the disclosing party; (b) a matter of public knowledge (or becomes a matter of public knowledge other than through breach of confidentiality by the other party); (c) rightfully furnished to the receiving party by a third party without confidentiality restriction; or (d) independently developed by the receiving party without reference to the disclosing party's Confidential Information. Each party shall (i) use Confidential Information of the other party only for the purposes of exercising rights or performing obligations in connection with this T&amp;C’s or any order/SOW hereunder; and (ii) protect from disclosure to any third parties any Confidential Information disclosed by the other party for a period commencing upon the date of disclosure until three (3) years thereafter, except with respect to Customer data, which shall remain Confidential Information until one of the exceptions stated in the above definition of Confidential Information applies. Notwithstanding the foregoing, either party may disclose Confidential Information to an Affiliate for the purpose of fulfilling its obligations or exercising its rights hereunder as long as such Affiliate complies with the foregoing and/or if required by law or regulatory authorities provided the receiving party has given the disclosing party prompt notice.
      </p>
      <p>
       15.	GENERAL.
      </p>
      <p>
       15.1. US. Where Services are performed in the United States (“US”), the applicable SOW is governed by the laws of California and each Party hereby expressly consents to the personal jurisdiction of either the California courts or the United States District Courts located in the State of California and agrees that any action relating to or arising out of the T&amp;C’s shall be instituted and prosecuted only in the Superior Court of the County of San Francisco or the United States District Court for the Northern District of California.
      </p>
      <p>
       15.2. Outside US. Where Services are performed outside the US, then (a) the applicable SOW is governed either (i) by the law in your country if you are located in a country in which Pivotal has a local sales subsidiary or (ii) by the laws of the Republic of Ireland, excluding in each case conflict of law rules; and (b) each party hereby expressly agrees that any action relating to or arising out of such SOW shall be subject to either (i) the exclusive jurisdiction of the courts in your country if you are located in a country in which Pivotal has a local sales subsidiary or (ii) the Dublin Courts.
      </p>
      <p>
       15.3. All SOWs. The U.N. Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods does not apply. These T&amp;Cs and the SOW comprise the complete statement of the agreement of the parties with regard to the subject matter thereof; and may be modified only by written agreement. Customer shall not assign these T&amp;C’s nor a purchase order or SOW or any right herein or delegate any performance without Pivotal’s prior written consent, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld. Pivotal may use Pivotal Affiliates or other sufficiently qualified subcontractors to provide Services to Customer, provided that Pivotal shall remain responsible to Customer for the performance thereof. If any part of the SOW is held unenforceable, the validity of the remaining provisions shall not be affected. The parties shall act as independent contractors for all purposes under the SOW. Nothing contained herein shall be deemed to constitute either party as an agent or representative of the other party, or both parties as joint venturers or partners for any purpose. Neither party shall be responsible for the acts or omissions of the other party, and neither party will have authority to speak for, represent or obligate the other party in any way without the prior written approval of the other party.
