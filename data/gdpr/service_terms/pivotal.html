      <br/>
      <p>
       The Statement of Work and/or Services Brief (referred to herein as “SOW”) and performance of the parties thereunder is governed by and subject to these General Terms And Conditions (“T&amp;Cs”) which by reference are incorporated and made a part of the SOW, subject to any quote. Pivotal means (i) Pivotal Software, Inc., if Customer is located in the United States; and (ii) the local Pivotal sales subsidiary, if Customer is located in a country in which Pivotal has a local sales subsidiary; and (iii) Pivotal Software International Limited, if Customer is located outside the United States and in a country in which Pivotal does not have a local sales subsidiary (in each case, referred to herein as “Pivotal”). “Customer” is identified as “Customer” or “You” herein, and collectively referred to with Pivotal as “Parties” or separately as “Party”. The T&amp;Cs (i) are subject to change by Pivotal from time to time; (ii) in effect as of the effective date of the SOW shall apply for the performance of that SOW; (iii) will not apply retroactively to any SOW; and (iv) are dated and archived when superseded by a newer version. Pivotal represents that in the event You have a current signed agreement with Pivotal regarding the subject-matter herein, then the terms and conditions of that agreement supersede any conflicting terms herein.
      </p>
      <p>
       1.	SOW TERMS AND CONDITIONS. Pivotal will provide the services as specified in the SOW ("Services") governed by the T&amp;Cs. In the event of a conflict between a term or condition in an SOW and those set forth here, these T&amp;Cs will govern unless explicitly superseded in the SOW or as otherwise stated in the preamble herein.
      </p>
      <p>
       2.	TERM AND TERMINATION. The SOW begins on the date stated therein or, as otherwise mutually agreed between the Parties, and shall remain in effect for the term length stated in the SOW (“Services Period”). Either Party may notify the other in case of the other’s alleged breach of a material provision of this SOW. The recipient shall have 30 days from the date of receipt of such notice to affect a cure. If the recipient of the notice fails to affect a cure within such period, then the sender of the notice shall have the option of sending a written notice of termination of the SOW, which notice shall take effect upon receipt. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Pivotal may suspend its services or terminate the SOW if Customer fails to pay an invoice when due and if such non-conformance is not cured within 10 days following receipt of notice from Pivotal.
      </p>
      <p>
       3.	PROJECT CHANGE REQUEST. Either Party may request a modification to any material provision of the SOW by submitting a Project Change Request (“PCR”).  Upon receipt of a PCR, Pivotal will estimate the financial and schedule impacts, if any.  The Parties will review these estimates to determine whether the PCR would be mutually acceptable. If the Parties agree on the PCR, Pivotal will attach the final PCR to the SOW.  If the Parties are unable to agree within five (5) business days after the PCR is submitted, then the submitting Party may either withdraw the PCR or terminate the SOW with reasonable notice.  If the SOW is terminated, due to an ability to reach agreement on a PCR, the only payments due are for the Work Product (defined herein below) delivered, Services performed, and expenses incurred by Pivotal prior to the effective termination date.
      </p>
      <p>
       4.	CUSTOMER MATERIALS DELAY. Customer acknowledges that Pivotal’s performance of the Services and delivery of the Work Product is contingent on Customer’s timely delivery of any customer materials (“Customer Materials”) provided to Pivotal in connection with the Services. Customer agrees that any reasonable scheduling or financial impacts caused by Customer’s failure to deliver Customer Materials within the specified time will be treated as a PCR.
      </p>
      <p>
       5.	PERSONNEL. Pivotal will determine the personnel assigned to perform the Services.  Customer may request in writing, with specific legal reasons stated, the replacement of Pivotal personnel or contractors.
      </p>
      <p>
       6.	PAYMENT TERMS. Pivotal shall submit invoices for fees and reimbursable costs and expenses as described in the SOW or quote plus all related taxes and withholdings, except for those based on Pivotal’s net income. If Customer is required to withhold taxes, then Customer will forward any withholding receipts to Pivotal at accounting@pivotal.io.

If all or a portion of any invoice is determined to be incorrect, the Parties will promptly investigate and correct or confirm the dispute. Pivotal is not obligated to perform its services unless Customer is current in payment of all fees and charges due. Except as otherwise set forth herein, payment obligations by Customer to Pivotal shall survive expiration or termination of the SOW.

       11.	IP INDEMNITY.
      </p>
      <p>
       11.1. Pivotal. Subject to Section 13 (Limitations of Liability), Pivotal shall (a) defend Customer against any third party claim that the Services and the Work Product (excluding Open Source Software and/or Third Party Materials) delivered by Pivotal to Customer infringe a trade secret, or a copyright enforceable in a country that is a signatory to the Berne Convention, and (b) pay the resulting costs and damages finally awarded against Customer by a court of competent jurisdiction or the amounts stated in a written settlement signed by Pivotal.
      </p>
      <p>

Each party shall (i) use Confidential Information of the other party only for the purposes of exercising rights or performing obligations in connection with this T&amp;C’s or any order/SOW hereunder; and (ii) protect from disclosure to any third parties any Confidential Information disclosed by the other party for a period commencing upon the date of disclosure until three (3) years thereafter, except with respect to Customer data, which shall remain Confidential Information until one of the exceptions stated in the above definition of Confidential Information applies.

       15.	GENERAL.
      </p>
      <p>
       15.1. US. Where Services are performed in the United States (“US”), the applicable SOW is governed by the laws of California and each Party hereby expressly consents to the personal jurisdiction of either the California courts or the United States District Courts located in the State of California and agrees that any action relating to or arising out of the T&amp;C’s shall be instituted and prosecuted only in the Superior Court of the County of San Francisco or the United States District Court for the Northern District of California.
      </p>
      <p>
       15.2. Outside US. Where Services are performed outside the US, then (a) the applicable SOW is governed either (i) by the law in your country if you are located in a country in which Pivotal has a local sales subsidiary or (ii) by the laws of the Republic of Ireland, excluding in each case conflict of law rules; and (b) each party hereby expressly agrees that any action relating to or arising out of such SOW shall be subject to either (i) the exclusive jurisdiction of the courts in your country if you are located in a country in which Pivotal has a local sales subsidiary or (ii) the Dublin Courts.
      </p>
      <p>
       15.3. All SOWs. The U.N. Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods does not apply. These T&amp;Cs and the SOW comprise the complete statement of the agreement of the parties with regard to the subject matter thereof; and may be modified only by written agreement.

Pivotal may use Pivotal Affiliates or other sufficiently qualified subcontractors to provide Services to Customer, provided that Pivotal shall remain responsible to Customer for the performance thereof. If any part of the SOW is held unenforceable, the validity of the remaining provisions shall not be affected. The parties shall act as independent contractors for all purposes under the SOW. Nothing contained herein shall be deemed to constitute either party as an agent or representative of the other party, or both parties as joint venturers or partners for any purpose. Neither party shall be responsible for the acts or omissions of the other party, and neither party will have authority to speak for, represent or obligate the other party in any way without the prior written approval of the other party.
