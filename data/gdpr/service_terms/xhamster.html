Welcome to Our Site’s User Agreement (hereinafter “Agreement” or “Terms and Conditions

Our Site is different from many other websites on the Internet as it contains advertisements, communications, and links posted by independent third parties, over which We exert no control and with which there is not necessarily any direct association
We do not get involved in any disputes that may develop between Our advertisers and others, and We do not facilitate communication between third parties
Therefore, You are urged to use Your own good judgment and common sense when responding to such advertisements, as We are not responsible for any interactions occurring between Our Users and Our advertisers
Federal law protects sites like Ours from civil claims, so We encourage You to independently research any information found in Our advertisements, before making any decisions
We hope that You thoroughly enjoy Our services, and anticipate that You will find Our Site useful and informative
Should You have any questions or comments regarding Our Site, or its policies, please feel free to contact Us via
