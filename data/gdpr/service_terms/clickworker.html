     </h3>
     <p>
      clickworker will present projects in the Workplace together with any applicable   conditions relating thereto (in each case only as an “invitation to submit an offer” - an “invitatio ad offerendum”).  On acceptance and establishment of their user accounts, Clickworkers may review projects that correspond to their qualification profile.  Clickworkers may submit offers to clickworker to complete projects subject to the conditions set forth in the applicable project description. clickworker is not required to accept any such offer(s).

     <p>
      Should clickworker accept an offer by a Clickworker, then the data necessary for the   consummation of any such project shall be made available in the Workplace.  Acceptance of the offer(s) of any Clickworker(s) by clickworker shall not give rise to any entitlement or expectation by clickworker that any such Clickworker(s) will in fact consummate any such project(s) in accordance with the conditions thereof.
     </p>
     <p>
      In return, clickworker shall not be required to accept any work product of any Clickworker that does not satisfy the conditions prescribed therefore in the applicable project description and which, as a consequence, is inadequate and unsatisfactory.  Without limitation, clickworker will not accept any work product submitted after expiration of the deadline prescribed therefore.
     </p>
     <p>
      Each Clickworker agrees to keep confidential vis-a-vis any third parties any and all data or project descriptions provided in connection with his / her performance of work for any project and to use any such data or project descriptions exclusively for the performance of work for clickworker.  Without limitation, each Clickworker must work and produce work product in a manner such that third parties have no access to any such data or project descriptions provided by clickworker.  These confidentiality obligations shall survive any termination of these Terms or the contractual relationship between any Clickworker and clickworker. clickworker reserves the right to exercise any and all available legal remedies (including without limitation by obtaining injunctive relief or pursuing claims for damages) against Clickworkers that culpably violate these provisions.
     </p>
     <p>
      If a Clickworker shall provide work product in a timely manner, then s/he shall receive provisional credit to his/her user account of the compensation set forth in the applicable project description.  However, this shall not constitute acceptance by clickworker of any such work product.  Any work product so delivered will be proofed and reviewed by clickworker.  Should any such review by clickworker reveal deficiencies in the work product, then such Clickworker will receive three calendar days to correct said work product.  Should any such revisions by a Clickworker be inadequate or should a Clickworker refuse to revise deficient work product, then clickworker will be deemed to have rejected and terminated the applicable contract with such Clickworker.  A Clickworker will not be owed any compensation in any such case.  In certain situations, there will be no possibility for a Clickworker to revise or correct deficient work product if, for example, projects must be finally completed by a specific deadline.  In any such situation such special condition will be set forth in the applicable project description.
     </p>
     <p>
      If clickworker finally accepts any work product (within 7 calendar days of delivery thereof to clickworker by a Clickworker), then such Clickworker will receive a final credit to his / her user account of the compensation provided therefor in the corresponding project description.  Any such compensation will be paid as provided in section 4, below.
