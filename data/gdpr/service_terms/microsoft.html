If you create a Microsoft account on behalf of an entity, such as your business or employer, you represent that you have the legal authority to bind that entity to these Terms
You cannot transfer your Microsoft account credentials to another user or entity
To protect your account, keep your account details and password confidential
You are responsible for all activity that occurs under your Microsoft account

If a healthcare provider decides to include any data made available from HealthVault in its records, it should store a copy in its own system
If there is a co-custodian of a record in your account (because one of you invited the other), you acknowledge that the co-custodian has full control over that record and may cancel your access to the record, manage other peoples' access to the record, and view the record's data including how and when the record is used
Microsoft does not support non-Microsoft credentials (such as Facebook and OpenID), so HealthVault customer support will not be able to help with sign-in issues for those
If you lose your sign-in credentials, or if the account where you got your credentials closes, you will not be able to recover your stored data
To help maintain continued access, we suggest you use more than one sign-in credential with your HealthVault account
Microsoft does not endorse or control, and is not responsible for, the operation, support, or security of non-Microsoft credentials you may use

Microsoft Rewards
i
Microsoft Rewards (the "
Program
") enables you to earn redeemable points for activities such as qualified searches, acquisitions, and other offers from Microsoft
Offers may vary by market
A search is the act of an individual user manually entering text for the good faith purpose of obtaining Bing search results for such user’s own research purposes and does not include any query entered by a bot, macro, or other automated or fraudulent means of any kind ("
Search
")
An acquisition is the process of purchasing goods or downloading and acquiring a license for digital content from Microsoft, whether free or paid ("
Acquisition
")
Rewards points are not offered for every purchase from Microsoft
Microsoft may offer additional opportunities to earn points from time to time, and each points-earning offer will not be available in perpetuity
Your earned points can be redeemed for items ("
Rewards
") in the redeem page
For more information see the Rewards section at
support
microsoft
com
("
FAQ
")
1
Program Requirements
You need a valid Microsoft account and your devices must meet the
minimum system requirements
The Program is open to users who reside in the markets listed in the FAQ
Individuals can have no more than one Program account, even if an individual has multiple email addresses, and households are limited to six accounts
The Program is solely for your personal and noncommercial use
2
Points
Except for sharing points within your Microsoft family (limits may apply) or donating your points to a nonprofit organization listed in the redemption center, you cannot transfer points
Points are not your personal property, and you may not obtain any cash or money in exchange for them
Points are awarded to you on a promotional basis
You cannot purchase points
Microsoft may limit the quantity of points or Rewards per person, per household, or over a set period (e
g
, a day) provided that you are not disadvantaged in breach of good faith
You may redeem no more than 550,000 points per calendar year in the Program
Points earned in the Program are not valid in, and may not be used in combination with, any other program offered by Microsoft or third parties
Unredeemed points expire if you do not earn or redeem any points for 18 months
3
Rewards
You may redeem your points by visiting the redeem page or you may contribute points to a listed nonprofit organization
There may be a limited number of a particular Reward available, and those Rewards will be delivered on a first-come, first-served basis
You may be required to provide additional information, like your mailing address and a telephone number (other than a VOIP or toll-free number), and you may also be asked to enter a fraud-prevention code or sign additional legal documents to redeem points for Rewards
Once you order a Reward, you cannot cancel it or return it for a refund of points except in the case of defective products or as required by applicable law
If you order a Reward that is out of stock or unavailable for other reasons, we may substitute a Reward of comparable value or refund your points
Microsoft may update the Rewards offered on the redeem page or discontinue offering specific Rewards
Some Rewards may have age eligibility requirements
Any such requirements will be included in the relevant offer
You are responsible for all federal, state, and local taxes and any other costs of accepting and using the Reward
Rewards will be emailed to the email address associated with your Microsoft account, so keep your email address up to date
Rewards that are undeliverable will not be reissued and are therefore forfeited
Rewards are not for resale
4
Cancelling Your Participation in the Program
Your Program account may be cancelled if you do not log in at least once in an 18-month period
Additionally, Microsoft reserves the right to cancel the Program account of a specific user for tampering with, abusing or defrauding the Program, or for breach of these terms
Upon Program cancellation (by you or us) or if the Program is suspended, you will have 90 days to redeem your points; otherwise, those points will be forfeited
At the point of cancellation, your right to use the Program and accrue future points ends
5
Other Conditions
Microsoft reserves the right to disqualify you; disable your access to the Program or your Rewards account; and/or withhold points, Rewards and charitable contributions, if Microsoft believes you are tampering with or abusing any aspect of the Program or may be engaging in activities that violate these Terms
